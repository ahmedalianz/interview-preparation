Next js is a framework build on top of React that adds extra features such as
1- SSR (server side rendering) which allows the server (faster) to render html pages instead of rendering it in browser (which improves SEO and performance)
2- SSG static site generation
3- Routing

Next js has its own next/head that we can use to put meta tags , but react needs react-helmet
