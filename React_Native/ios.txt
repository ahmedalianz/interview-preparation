    Delete project's temp files located at ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
    Delete ProjectName.xcworkspace
    Delete Podfile.lock file and Pods folder
    Run pod install.
    Open the newly created ProjectName.xcworkspace file and build.

----> Completly remove Cocoapods
    Unlink and uninstall CocoaPods: Ensure that CocoaPods is unlinked and uninstall it using Homebrew:
    Remove any remaining CocoaPods files: Remove any remaining files related to CocoaPods:
    Check for other installations: Verify if CocoaPods is installed via RubyGems or other methods:
    Remove any remaining CocoaPods gems: If CocoaPods is listed, you can remove it using gem uninstall:
    Verify removal: Finally, check if CocoaPods has been completely removed:

    do next steps in reverse
    pod --version
    sudo gem uninstall cocoapods
    gem list --local | grep cocoapods
    sudo rm -rf ~/.cocoapods
    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/pod
    brew unlink cocoapods
    brew uninstall cocoapods
    
    Check for other installations: Run the following command to list all installed gems and see if CocoaPods is listed:
    Check executable path: Run which pod to see the path of the pod executable. This can help determine where CocoaPods is installed from.
    Search for CocoaPods executable: You can use the find command to search for any remaining CocoaPods executables:
    Remove any remaining CocoaPods executables: If you find any remaining CocoaPods executables, you can remove them manually:
    Rehash RubyGems: If you've removed CocoaPods installed via RubyGems, you may need to rehash RubyGems to reflect the changes:

    do next steps in reverse
    hash -r
    sudo rm -rf <path_to_pod_executable>
    sudo find / -name "pod" -type f
    which pod
    gem list --local
    inside Library/.cocoapods/repo 
    git clone https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git master

----> Error in Building due to node version mismatch

    https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/36886
 
    node version used must be same as xcode using
 
    export NODE_BINARY=$(command -v node)


===> Start New project
    add source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git' in Podfile
    add export NODE_BINARY=$(command -v node) in xcode in bundle code & images

===> No Script present & jsbundel not exist
    do this => npx react-native bundle --entry-file index.js --platform ios --dev false --bundle-output ios/main.jsbundle --assets-dest ios
    add mian.jsbundle in project name and make sure it's in build settings copy bundle resources
